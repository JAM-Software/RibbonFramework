Please see http://www.bilsen.com/windowsribbon for detailed information 
about this library.

Version history:
5/27/2011:  Version 1.0: Initial release by Erik van Bilsen.
7/30/2011:  Version 1.1: Added support for linking UI Commands to Delphi
            actions. See the "Text Pad with Action List" sample application
            and the web site for information on how to do this.
            Also, applications using this framework will also run on
            earlier Windows version now, but without ribbon functionality.
            The TUIRibbon.Available property can be used to check if the
            Ribbon Framework is available on the system. If not, you could
            enable a more traditional user interface.
            These changes were inspired by contributions from
            Patrick Kolla-ten Venne. Many thanks for this! 
12/17/2012: Version 1.2: Added Delphi XE3 compatibility (thanks to Cherryl
            Martin for pointing this out).
